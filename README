If you want to give me money because you'll make money from it and you indeed have a soul, fine (if so contact me). I will warn you, however, that I'd never programmed in Objective-C or on the iPhone SDK prior to this so the code is likely to be a bit, shall we say, crappy."

Since the author doesn't have time I have decided to take it over,
my goal is that people can use this a base for their Laconica/Identica Clients :D

A new name, I have decided to call the project Laphonica.

If you use the code please consider adding Floss.pro as one of the supported server.
